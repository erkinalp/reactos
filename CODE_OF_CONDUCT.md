# Code of Conduct

Be respectful toward other members of the community. Don't initiate or engage in discussions that are designed to insult, inflame, attack, or incite hate/discrimination/bullying against others. Don't feed the trolls. If we detect any kind of behaviour we consider unacceptable, we reserve the right to ban, block, or remove the involved members from any or all of our communities.

Never ever attempt to contribute or even look at leaked code from Microsoft Windows or any other proprietary software. Looking at but not copying proprietary code with expired copyright may or may not be acceptable depending on the specific artifact, and will be resolved on case-by-case basis.
